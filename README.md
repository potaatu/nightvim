# NightVim

## What it is
Just a **SINGLE FILE** configuration for Neovim with color scheme included (`tokyonight`).

## What to do
Simply copy-paste the `init.vim` file to `$HOME/.config/nvim/` directory

## What you Get
* A minimalistic Neovim experience
* Tokyonight Colorscheme embedded inside the config file
* A custom-built Statusline which nicely complements the colorscheme
* Mappings for viewing `Netrw` as a sidebar (like `NERDTree`, but no bloat)
* The `Current Line Number` color changes when entering insert mode
* A few other tweeks here and there
* Lots of giggles :)
